Project Announcement

This is an early announcement for the final project. You don't have to start the project now, but it would be helpful to see what the project looks like and familiarize yourself with the OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium toolkit.

When it comes to selecting a game for the final project, tabulated RL ones are too simple. Most students choose either continuous state/action space (requires approximate RL) or a vision-based problem (This is harder, but a great opportunity to apply computer vision and/or deep RL, which we will learn in later weeks). Think about it for a while. The submission box will appear in the finals week.

Description

This project aims to introduce a modern tool for Reinforcement Learning that is being developed rapidly in the AI field. You will learn to use the OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium toolkit, create your AI agent, and then test the AI algorithm performance in the OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium environment.

OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium has various environments, including classical control games, Atari games, robotics simulators, etc. Please choose any environment of your choice, except the CartPole, which is an example of a toy problem. Although it's your call, we recommend you explore something other than a classic control problem if you can afford it or are interested.

Deliverables

At the end of the project, you will deliver the following:

A Git repository with working codes or notebook. These must be commented and explained.
A video clip of a demo. Must be either a mp4 unlisted YouTube link or transformed to a .gif image. You can leave those links in the report or embed them in the notebook.
A report with the following contents:
A short overview of what your project is about (e.g., You're building/testing certain RL models in certain environments. Yes, you may test your algorithm in more than one environment if your goal is to test an algorithm's performances in different settings.)
Your approach: Explain your environment, choice of model(s), the methods and purpose of testing and experiments, and any required troubleshooting.
Your result: Show the result and your interpretation of your experiment. Any iterative improvements summary.
A conclusion, discussion, reflection, or suggestions for improvements.
References: Please include all relevant reference links (Git, YouTube videos, etc.)
Collaboration

You may collaborate on ideas, troubleshooting, discussions, and feedback.

Your work should be your own.

Using Online Resources

If you find other similar projects online, you can refer to, learn from them, and tweak them, but don't copy or use them with just minor changes. 

Please list the links as references.
